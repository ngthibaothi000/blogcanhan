In this second part of the series we'll show you where to find the full series

When you created a series, you'll probably want to link to the full set of blogposts.  
In this example we used `series-setup` as our series name.

This means we can now go to [http://localhost:1313/series/series-setup/](http://localhost:1313/series/series-setup/) to see all the blog posts of this serie.
